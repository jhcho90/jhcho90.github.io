## About Me

My name is Jaehoon, and I work as a senior research engineer at Hyundai Motors in South Korea. 
Working on autonomous driving systems has allowed me to solve many real-world problems by leveraging computer vision algorithms. 
Challenging myself awards me the most satisfaction towards solving real-world problems.
Recently, I have been interested in multi-task learning (MTL), including 2d/3d object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation, but not limited to.
