## About Me

Hi! 
My name is Somi Jeong and I am currently a Ph.D. student in School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Yonsei University, supervised by Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn. 
I study computer vision, and my research interests are generative models, 3D reconstruction, and multi-spectral/multi-modal visual correspondence.
